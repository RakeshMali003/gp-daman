<p>We feel that it is our important duty to appraise the students and their parents / guardians about the necessity of having satisfactory attendance in theory &amp; practical classes and the consequences thereof for non-attendance of these rules &amp; regulations.

<p>If any student remains absent continuously for more than three days, he / she will not be allowed to attend lectures/practicals without permission from the Principal on the first three occasions in a semester.Further such occasions he/she will not be allowed to attend the lectures. / practicals without being accompanied by his /her parents/guardians. Such irregular students will be liable for disciplinary action taken by competent authority.</p>
<p>For us, as an institution, the environment and discipline in class &amp; college is very important. The student being a vital component of the Education System- his/her irregularity adversely affects the performance of the system.
